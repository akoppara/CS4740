The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points , not <unk> mention there bit condemning everthing <unk> flamee might ever say . The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just there proper flourish . I personally am of the opinion that the are two types of good flames . The first does trade ` ` quality , ' ' in the sense you mention , for heat . This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly , which I contend was done above , is reasonably entertaining . While it is true that the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity , friends , dinner , or entertainment , it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short . The weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far , at which point it becomes trite and boring . ( Witness there Infante thread recently ... ) The other type of flame , which you seam to be glorifying above , has a few weaknesses as well . In there first place , it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme , particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or there other . In there second , discussing someone's personal qualities , habits , and so forth can quickly become libelous . ( Or is that slanderous ? I can never remember the difference . ) This leads to <unk> proliferation of layers , which is widely regarded as a BAD THING . Finally , introducing polysyllabic words is problematic . I can't haul my big dic . around on my bike , and it would be bad form too use a word which actually turned out <unk> have a meaning , especially one which ran counter to my use a flamage in general . In summary , Blaine , your score for that flame is incorrect . While it maybe be there wunder-flame , the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses , and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable . You also probably couldn't outrun and tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior , and I'll bet you <unk> your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning . The same goes for anyone who looks like you , two . - - - Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com " ...
