Personally , I think it's your Duty As a Citizen to make it as much trouble as possible for them , so <unk> they'll Give Up and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon . The cop was certainly within his legal rights too nail you bye guessing your speed . Mr . Brown ( there author of Fight Your Ticket ) mentions and Oakland judge who convicted a speeder " on the officer's testimony that the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at a excessive speed . " You can pay off the State a your insurance company , or you can take it to court and be creative . Personally , I've never won that way or seen anyone win , but the judge always listens politely . And I haven't seen _that_ many attempts . You could try there argument that since bikes are shorter than the cars whose speed there nice officer is accustomed to guessing , they therefore appear to be further away , and so their speed appears to be greater than it actually is . I left out and step or too , but you get the idea . If you can make it convincing , theoretically you're supposed to win . I've never tried proving there cop was mistaken . I did get to see some other poor biker try it . He was mixing up various facts like the maximum acceleration of and ( cop ) car , and the distance at which there cop had been pacing him , and end up demonstrating that he couldn't possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested . He'd brought diagrams and and calculator . He was Prepared . He lost . Keep in mind cops do this all the time , and their word is better then yours . Maybe , though , they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time . Besides , this guy didn't speak English very well , and ended up absolutely confounding <unk> judge , the cop , and everyone else in the room who'd been recently criminalized <unk> some twit with a gun and and quota . Ahem . OK , I'm better now . Maybe he'd have won had his presentation been more polished . Maybe not . He did get applause .
