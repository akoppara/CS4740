I agree with this 100 % . After all , when you grab under his chin and are careful too keep your hands away from his twisting head , what is he going to do - - tailwag you <unk> death ? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped <unk> and 130 lb . German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand a his lower jaw in the other . Now I'm holding his mouth open ( no way is he strong enough to clamp down ) <unk> he can do nothing . HOWEVER , all this macho shit aside , the fact is that when you are riding a bike and and dog is arrowing to intercept , it maybe be unwise for you <unk> stop a try to deal with the dog , for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly . By all means , if you do kick there dog or otherwise get its attention , STOP and STAY <unk> . If you kick there dog a ride away , that is a victory for the dog - - it drove you out of its territory . It is not even a qualified victory , it is a victory . If you kick it and STOP , and sit there , 99 % of dogs will say , " Oh , shit ! This guy's serious ! " <unk> back off . Now you have established your dominance over the dog , and it probably will not bother you again . Llamas , however , are and different storey . If you stop near and llama , it will just hop on a insist on a ride . And that's if you're lucky ; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and steal it ! - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in the guise of public safety .
