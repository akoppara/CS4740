I'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident too there hospital administrator . Specify the date a time . If possible there names of the technicians . Send a copy too there clinician under whose care your friend was admitted . I say this because , though your friend has no argument with the doctor , I have founded that administrators sometime ignore complaints until the patient becomes litigious . Clinicians maybe not have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised too find themselves named in a suit . If the is no response within a week send a follow up letter . Attach and photocopy of the original letter . Do this weekly until you do get a response . CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary . The scanner can be and badly place for the claustrophobic . There was and interesting study in the BMJ , about 10 years ago , which <unk> that around 10 % of people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would never have another . This compares with 15 % who said the same about and lumbar puncture . Don Mackie - his opinions
