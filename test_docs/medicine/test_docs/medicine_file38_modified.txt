There are many organisms , viral , bacterial , and fungal , which can cause meningitits , and the coarse of these infections varies widely . The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age : in adults pneumococcus ( the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia ) is the <unk> common cause , while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the almost common cause . What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis , which is the second almost common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups , but with lower incidence in infants . This organism is also called there " meningococcus " , and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur a are popularized in the press . Without prompt treatment ( and even WITH it in some cases ) , the organism typically causes death within a day . This organism , feared as it is , is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults . It can get too there meninges bye different ways , but blood borne spread is probably there usual case . Rifampin ( and aural antibiotic ) is often given too family a contacts of and case of meningococcal meningitis , <unk> the way . Sorry , but I don't have time for a more detailed reply . Meningitis is a huge topic , and sci.med can't do it justice . - km
