From : paulson@tab00.larc.nasa.gov ( Sharon Paulson ) Subject : food-related seizures ? I am posting too this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to <unk> <unk> . I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced and seizure on November 3 , 1992 at 6:45 AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes . She is perfectly healthy , had never experienced anything like this before , and the is no history of seizures in either side of the family . All there tests ( EEG , MRI , EKG ) came out negative so there decision was made too do nothing a just wait to see if it happened again . Well , we were going along fine a there other morning , April 5 , she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of serial , Fruit Loops ( I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while ... ) So I pour it in her bowl and think " Oh , oh , this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure . " Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures . This was her first exposure to a sugar coated serial since the last seizure . When I mentioned what she ate there first time as a possible reason for the seizure there neurologist basically negated that as a idea . Now after this second episode , so similar in nature too there first , even he is scratching his head . Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when <unk> person has a seizure . Once again we are waiting . I have been thinking that it would be good too get too as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing . I know that members of the medical community are sometime loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health a well-being . Anyway , as you can guess , I am worried sick about this , and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has . Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on hear .
