Indeed they were worried about that . One concern was the possibility that they would loose and motor or something on the way up , and make orbit but one that was two low to give HST and useful lifetime against atmospheric drag . I <unk> the decision was too deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months . In fact we got a excellent orbit , on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do . I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment . You would have the horrendous cost of transporting , cleaning , re-testing , and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground , in addition to the lost observing time a there cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit there second time . And , you would probably STILL need a ( third ) servicing mission in a few years as gyros a other components wear out . Better too have to servicing missions in space ( which could well happen ) then to bring HST down and take it up again . Ben
