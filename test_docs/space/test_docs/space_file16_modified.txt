Although the company ( name escapes me at the moment ) sells images world-wide , you can bet your last dollar ( franc ? ? ) that the French gov't gets first dibs . I remember a few years ago ( about the time SPOT was launched ) , I was speaking to my Dad ( <unk> USAF officer ) about this <unk> that , and I happend to mention SPOT ( I think we were talking about technology utilization ) . He just about <unk> ballistic . He wanted to know how I new about SPOT and just what I new . I guess that space surveillance is such a sensitive topic in the Air Force that he couldn't believe that I would read about such a system in the popular press ( ie . AV weak ) . mark , - - = = = Mark L .
