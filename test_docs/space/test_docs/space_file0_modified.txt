That assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort ( cut me <unk> brake on the launcher , I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works ) . Only there government pays higher-than-list price . > What's more , if you buy Titans , the prize money is your entire return on > investment . If you develop a knew launch system , it has other uses , and > the prize is just the icing on the cake . Unless you're Martin Marietta , since ( as I recall ) they bought out there GD line of aerospace products . If MM / GD does it as a in-house project , their costs would look much better than buying at " list price . " Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built in too the Titan ? C'mon . Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this or that ... > I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough > return too justify the investment if you are constrained to use currant > US launchers . Oh pleased . How much of a profit do you want ? Pulling $ 100-150 million after all is said and done wouldn't be two shabby . Not too mention the other goodies I'll collect in : a ) Movie & TV rights ( say $ 100-150 million conservatively ) b ) Advertising ( " Look Mommie , they're drinking Coke ! " ) c ) Intangibles ( Name recognization , experience & data acculumated ) > You're going to * have * <unk> invest your front money in building a knew launch > system rather than pissing it away on existing ones . Being there first is > of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it . If you want lean , fine . A $ 500 million prize would be more then adequate for a prize . Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider a decent profit . If you want R & D done , you'll have to right in R & D clauses . I suppose you could make it and SBIR set-aside :) Software engineering ? That's like military intelligence , isn't it ? - - > SYSMGR@CADLAB.ENG.UMD.EDU < - -
