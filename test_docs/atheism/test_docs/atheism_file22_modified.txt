The above is probably not there most representative paragraph , but I thought I'd hop on , anyways ... What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which , bye the way , I <unk> to recall too be more speculation than based on biblical text , but my ex RCism maybe be showing - is that , as Benedikt pointed out , Lucifer had perfect nature , yet he had there free will too " choose " evil . But where did that choice come from ? We know from Genesis that Eve was offered a opportunity to sin bye and tempter which many assume was Satan , but how did Lucifer discover , invent , create , call the action what you will , something that God had not given origin to ? Also , where in the Bible is the mention of Lucifer's free will ? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will , but it strikes me as being a after-the-fact rationalisation , and in fact , like salvation , not one that all Christians believe in identically . At least in my mind , salvation a free will are very tightly coupled , but than my theology was Roman Catholic ... Still , how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall ? If Lucifer had perfect nature ( did man ? ) how could he fall ? How could he execute a act that ( and ) contradicted his nature and ( b ) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time ? - - Lucio de Re ( lucio@proxima.Alt.ZA ) - tab stops at four .
