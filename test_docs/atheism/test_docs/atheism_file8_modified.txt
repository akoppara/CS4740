It's not really their _decision_ to be tried . The rulings _do_ have legal consequences , but only in Islamic law a not in UK law ( this should be obvious ) . Enforcing and judgment is distinct from the making of <unk> judgment . Take for example there judgments of the World Court . This is a internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic affect but which _are_ important despite the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced > The person maybe be excommunicated ( or similar ) but if it decided to > mete out violent laws such as the fatwa then it would be breaking UK laws > itself , and the persons doing such would be liable to prosecution . Of course , have you read any of this thread before this post ? > To ignore > the country's laws in preference too religious laws which are not indigenous > <unk> the country in question is a absurd a arrogant notion . Of course , it is a sort of anarchism . Anarchism is explicitly against Islam . Thank you for your well reasoned response , but it is beside the points I've been making in this thread . Gregg
