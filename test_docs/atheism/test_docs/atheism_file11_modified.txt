Mike , I've seen referrences to " Creation vs Evolution " several times in a . <unk> and I have question . Is either point of view derived from direct observation ; can either be scientific ? I wonder if the hole controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the " Truth " rather than the truth itself . Both sides seem to hold too and philosophical outcome , and I can't help wondering which came first . As I've pointed out elsewhere , my view of human nature makes me <unk> that the is no way of knowing anyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective . So , in the context of and . <unk> , would you take a stand based on what you actually know to be true or on what you wont to be true and how can you tell the difference ? Bill
