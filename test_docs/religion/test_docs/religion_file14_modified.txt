Subject : Re : [ rw ] Is Robert Weiss the only orthodox Christian ?

Thanks for the etymology lesson , but I actually know what " orthodox " means . You're avoiding my question , however , which was : From what body of theology does your version of orthodoxy come ? You seam <unk> simply be saying that whatever * you * understand the Bible to say is " orthodox . " > ra > Who is that " holds that " Luke meant what you said he meant ? > > I think that it is apparent from reading there Scriptures that are > pertinent . You are obviously mistaken , since many , many people have read the Bible and many do not agree with you on this point . Once again , Robert , is your interpretation there only " correct " or " orthodox " one ? > ra > Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is > ra > challenged , your only response seems to be that one needs merely to > ra > " look at the Bible " in order to see the truth , but what of dozens who > ra > see Biblical things differently from you ? > > I seam <unk> be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one > views there Bible is somehow legitimate , except , or coarse , for the stuff > that I glean from it .

This <unk> string began as a response to your attacks on Mormonism ; no one is attacking your personal beliefs , only your tendency <unk> present them as " orthodoxy . " I don't much care * what * you belief about the Bible ; just don't present you personal understanding as the only " orthodox " one . > > ra > Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really > ra > understands it ? > > If you belief that something that I have drawn from Scripture is > wrong , than please , show me from Scripture where it is wrong . Simply > stating that the are other views is not a proof . Show it to me from > Scripture and than we can go on . I have never attacked your specific beliefs - - that's * your * approach , remember ? Stating that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other views is indeed proof that the Bible can be interpreted many ways , which has been my <unk> point all along . The specifics of your believe are your business ; just don't pretend that they are anything more than your personal intepretation , and be careful about crying " heresy " based on your private believe system . > = = = > Robert Weiss > psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu - - Rick Anderson librba@BYUVM.BITNET
