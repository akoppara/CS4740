You're admitting and lot more than that . You are admitting that your morals are situational . You are admitting that the actions of other people <unk> the situation you are in help too determine how you judge there moral significance of one of your own actions . If you employ X degree of force , that's not moral , but if you employ X degree of force , but previously someone else has employed Y degree of force , and the situation is thus-and-so , that * is * moral . This is <unk> different from saying " Employing force on other people is amoral , period . Unfortunately , from time to time we are obliged to do this amoral thing for reasons of self-preservation , and so we have to bare the moral consequences of that . For what it's worth - <unk> yes , I know you claim to be and agnostic - it's this ability to re-label things from " amoral " <unk> " moral " that I find one of the * least * attractive qualities of the religious mind . jon .
