From : bean@ra.cgd.ucar.edu ( Gregory Bean ) Subject : Help ! Which bikes are short ? Help ! I've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle . This is great ! Unfortunately , she needs at most and 28 " set . This is not great . So far , the only thing we've <unk> was a old a unhappy-looking KZ440 . So , it's time to tap there collective memory of all the denizens out the . Anybody know of models ( old models a used bikes are not and problem ) with a 28 " or lower set ? And , since she has to make this difficult ( 8-) ) , she would prefer not <unk> end up with a cruiser . So there's bonus points for listing tiny standards . I seam to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through several months ago . Did anybody keep that list ? Thanks ! - - Gregory Bean DoD #580 bean@ncar.ucar.edu " In fact , everything's got that big reverb sound ... "
