I have to admit that the almost disgusting feature of Volvo's is their marketing . It looks like Volvo uses something like " Do you dare <unk> risk your family in any car ? " attitude , which is <unk> annoying in the long run . But now Volvo has produced a <unk> good car , the Volvo 850 . Front drive , 2.4 L 20 valves motor , completely knew chassis etc . Even the British magazine " CAR " liked it ( <unk> belief me , that is <unk> much for a Volvo ) . And the American magazine " Road & Track " said that " This is not your uncle Olof's car " , and in a positive sense . But in any case , I'd still like to own there 960 estate . Strong , tank-like chassis , 3.0 L inline six , rear drive . :-) :-) BTW , the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar drivers ... :-) :-) :-) :-) What ? You mean what I drive ? A cheapo Japanese ( <unk> Toyota ) of coarse , I do not have money for a * car * . ( like BMW , Merc , Jaguar , Saab 9000 , Volvo 850 ( or 960 ) , etc ) If I had the money , I would have * bad * problems deciding which one <unk> bye :-) :-) :-) .
