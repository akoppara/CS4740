Nick's write about this . It's always easier to obtain forgiveness than permission . Not many people remember that Britain's King George III expressly forbid his american subjects to cross there alleghany / appalachian mountains . Said subjects basically said , " Stop us if you can . " He couldn't . > If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation , who will > stop you from doing it . Maybe not acknowledge you ? That's how the USA started . Of course , that's also how the Bolivarian Republic started ( ca . 1800-1820 ) in central america . It didn't have quiet there staying power of the USA . I'm sure the are more examples of going far away a then ignoring authority , but none jump to mind write now . > What can happen is <unk> find a nation which is acknowledged , and offer your > services as a space miner and than go mine there asteroids / mars / moon or what > ever .. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble .. Or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to carry out as " scientific research " which just coincidentally requires there recovery of megatonnes of minerals ( or whatever ) , then go at it . > Basically find a country who wants to go into space , but can't for soem reason > or another , but who will give you a " hone " .. Such as Saudia Arabia or > whatever .. Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya ( I think ) in the late ' 70 ' s for his commercial space launch project ( one of the very earliest ) . It was killed <unk> Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise missiles in Africa , which made Libya renege on the arrangement . Doug Loss
