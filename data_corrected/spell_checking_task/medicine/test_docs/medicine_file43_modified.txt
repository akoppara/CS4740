From : ceci@lysator.liu.se ( Cecilia Henningsson ) Subject : Q : Repelling wasps ? ( This is a cross post to rec.gardens and sci.med . Set the follow-up ( line in the header , depending on what kind of advise you give , or ( e-mail directly too me : ceci@lysator.liu.se . ) I have a problem with wasps - - they seam to love me . Last summer I couldn't spend more than ten too fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me . I am asking for advise on how to repel wasps . This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next too one of my tiny ponds . The caretaker ( poor fellow ! ) will have to take care of them , and that will give me <unk> head start on them . Last year we couldn't find any nest . Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter , other wasps will almost likely vie for the territory . Is there anything I can grow , rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards ? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants , I wont to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else . Would it help too remove there ponds and the bird bath ? The wasps seam to come to drink at them , and I suppose that their prey will breed in them . The black tits seam to be afraid of the wasps , because as soon as the wasp season starts , they stop coming too have their bath . Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps , they <unk> to love me . The advise I usually get when I ask what <unk> do about wasps , is too stand still <unk> not wave my arms . I've got some painful stings when trying to follow that <unk> . I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes , to no avail . They still love me , and come for me , even when I'm in the middle of and crowd . So far only too things seem to work : To kill it dead or <unk> run into the house a close all doors and windows . NB : I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees , just wasps .
