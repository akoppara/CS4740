I am reluctant to summarize it , for then you will have my opinion of what the article says , rather than your own opinion . I think it is important enough for you to take the trouble too go to there library and get the article . The title is " The shot doctors " <unk> it appears on Pages 96-100 of the February , 1988 issue of Consumer Reports . The following excerpt from the article maybe entice you to read the hole article : Too often , shots are overused ... " When you put a patient on shots , you've got a annuity for life , " <unk> former president of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology told CU . [ page 97 ]
