From : Stephen Dubin <sdubin@igc.apc.org> Subject : Re : Pregnency without sex ? I think you must have there same hygiene teacher I had in 1955 . There is a storey about the Civil War about <unk> soldier who was shot in the groin . The bullet , after passing through one of his testes , <unk> entered the abdomen of and young woman standing nearby . Later , when she ( and young woman of unimpeachible virtue ) was shown to be pregnant ; <unk> soldier did <unk> honorable thing of marrying her . According to this <unk> , they lived happily ever after . Perhaps the almost famous of Mr . Rau's classes was the time he would come into class brandishing and aluminum turning mandrel ( tapering from about 3/8 " too 1/2 " over a 10 inch length ) . He would say , " Boys , do you know what this is ? It's a medical instrument called and ' cock reamer ' a it's used to unclog your penis when you have VD . They just ram it up the without and anesthetic ! " Needless to say this had a chilling affect . I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour . Later in life as I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible urethral sounds that are actually used , I could not escape thinking that I might one day see , " Reamer , Cock ( style of Rau ) .
