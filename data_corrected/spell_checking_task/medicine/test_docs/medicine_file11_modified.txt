In cats , the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces . The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus . The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born , or it maybe be very severe . Toxo <unk> cause blindness a mental retardation . Having a cat in the same apartment should not be and problem ; however , pregnant women should not scoop or change there cat's litterbox . In addition , whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his / her hands before handling anything else , especially food . Information came from _The Merck Manual , 15th Ed . _ I hope this information is helpful too you . Elisa picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu
