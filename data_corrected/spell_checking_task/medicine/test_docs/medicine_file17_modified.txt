The majority of Schatzki's rings described by x-ray , however , wnd up being due to inflammation instead of the congenital Schatzki's ring . Occassionally and cancer masquerades as a ring . You should have there endoscopy to see if it is due to there heartburn , and if so , you will need treatment for the heartburn ong term . The balloon dilation is a alternative too cutting open your chest a cutting out and section of the esophagus , so dilation is not at all invasive , considering the alternative . > The second issue : [ summarized ] He has had extra heartbeats for the past 3 to 4 years , and once was symptomatic from them , with some lightheadedness .

Both seemed to develop at about the > same time . I ' not a expert on heart problems , but PVC's are common and have been overtreated in the past . My personal experience , and I have there same history an build you do ( related to there heart , that is ) , is that my PVC's come and go , with some months causing anxiety . Taking on more fluids seems to help , and they seam worse in the summer . Remember that <unk> slow heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent , so perhaps it is a indication of and healthy cardiac system ( but ask an expert about that last point , especially ) Good luck , hope we don't die of arrhythmias .
