You'd have to purify the river water first . I'm not sure how practical that is with the Mississippi . You'd better check with health agencies along there way to see if the are toxic chemicals in the river . If it is just microorganisms , dozens can be filtered or killed , but you <unk> need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals . Better be same then sorry . Obviously , drinking the river without processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria a parasites . - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect , and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful to surrender it too soon .
