From : lansd@dgp.toronto.edu ( Robert Lansdale ) Subject : Advice sought : Turning font outlines into renderable polygons I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by and 3D scanline renderer . I have been studying there problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system . Well , I now have the opportunity <unk> write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end . The main problem I face is how to use the even / odd or non-winding rules too turn there outlines into a single outline polygon ( my renderer can handle complex polygons so <unk> is no need to reduce the polygons too simple polygons ) . For example , in the letter " O " <unk> are <unk> outlines : 1 ) The outside outline which is clockwise ( TrueType font ) 2 ) The inside outline which is counterclockwise . One common solution used by and number of rendering packages is <unk> simply connect there inner outline to there outer outline at the point where the too outlines are closest . This is equivalent <unk> descibing and " polygon with holes " . The renderer will <unk> make the appropriate whole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction too there outside edges . I do not wont <unk> use this simplistic system since : 1 ) It will not handle all outline fonts properly ( it is not <unk> simple matter to connect there outer outline to there inner outline for some fancy fonts ) . 2 ) It does not properly handle the even / odd or non-winding rules . From my research over the years there proper solution is <unk> use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids ( as is done by there Postscript a TrueType font rasterizers ) . These trapezoidal polygons can than be easily a properly rendered by <unk> 3D scanline renderer . My question is : are the any better solutions to turning <unk> outlines into polgyons other then there trapezoid decomposer ? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons . Another question , for dozens in the know : what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and / or offset curves for font outlines ? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I can't tell which method is the best too implement . Thanks for any pointers . --> Rob Lansdale - - Robert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619 Dynamic Graphics Project Internet : lansd@dgp.toronto.edu Computer Systems Research Institute UUCP : .. ! uunet ! dgp.toronto.edu ! lansd University of Toronto Bitnet : lansd@dgp.utoronto Toronto , Ontario M5S 1A4 , CANADA
