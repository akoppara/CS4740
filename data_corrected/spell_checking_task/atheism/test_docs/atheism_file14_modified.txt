It is good to hear that the are a few reasonable Christians about . If only dozens christian " scientists " would take note . ( In Australia the is a very strong movement , and bunch of christian scientists who <unk> that every single event in the bible is exactly true , and that the is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics . For example , the are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old , and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years , and this has not been accounted for . :-] ) > The book says that Jesus was either a liar , or he was crazy ( and > modern day Koresh ) or he was actually who he said he was . Or ( of coarse ) , that he never existed , and the bible was a storey , and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people . Did Tony follow that one up ? > Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows . Who would > die for a lie ? Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar ? People > gathered around him a kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing > someone who was or had been healed . Millions of people have " died for a lie " . This point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined ( and great many religious arguments work in that way ) , but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the believe that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders . The list is endless . The Aztecs lost , BTW . > Call me a fool , but I believe he did heal people . That is perfectly reasonable , but it is not grounds for me ( or anyone ) too become a christian . More to the point , it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the " real thing " . > Niether was he and lunatic . Would more than a entire nation be drawn > too someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example > anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool , logical people see > this <unk> away . Have you ever seen and documentary about the raise of Nazi Germany ? More too there point , did Tony mention this ? One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues fools , or illogical men , their support of Hitler was based ( I presume ) upon a emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles . Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane ... > Therefore since he wasn't a liar or and lunatic , he must have been there > real thing . Hmmm ... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of <unk> " Therefore ... " > Some other things to note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in > the psalms , Isaiah a elsewhere in 24 hrs alone . This in his betrayal > and Crucifixion . I don't have my Bible with me at this moment , next time I > right I will use it . This is ( unfortunately ) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible . The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is too treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present . If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally , he or she will end up in all sorts of shit . Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who <unk> the events described in the bible took place , but too convince someone , who thinks there bible is total fiction , that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless . For example , in mathematics you cannot say " and is equal to b because an is equal to b " . > I don't think most people understand what and Christian is . That would possibly explain why the have so many people being killed in religious wars , and why the are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct .

I think if you posted this part too alt.religion you would get more flames then hear :-) . I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of and stranger should be of interest too other people . Someone famous said that the too evils in life , polititians and churchs , one rules by fear of the living , the other by fear of the dead . If I am pressed I could probably find the exact quotation . Cheers , Charles .
